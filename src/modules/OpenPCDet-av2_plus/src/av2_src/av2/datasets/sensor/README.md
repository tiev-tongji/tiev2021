# Argoverse 2 Sensor Dataset Overview

## Dataset Size

The Argoverse 2 Sensor Dataset is the successor to the Argoverse 1 3D Tracking Dataset. AV2 is larger, with 1,000 scenes totalling 4.2 hours of driving data, up from 113 scenes in Argoverse 1.

The total dataset amounts to 1 TB of data in its extracted form. Each vehicle log is approximately 15 seconds in duration and 1 GB in size, including ~150 LiDAR sweeps on average, and ~300 images from each of the 9 cameras (~2700 images per log).

## Sensor Suite

Lidar sweeps are collected at 10 Hz, along with 20 fps imagery from 7 ring cameras positioned to provide a fully panoramic field of view, and 20 fps imagery from 2 stereo cameras. In addition, camera intrinsics, extrinsics and 6-DOF ego-vehicle pose in a global coordinate system are provided. Lidar returns are captured by two 32-beam lidars, spinning at 10 Hz in the same direction, but separated in orientation by 180Â°. The cameras trigger in-sync with both lidars, leading to a 20 Hz frame-rate. The nine global shutter cameras are synchronized to the lidar to have their exposure centered on the lidar sweeping through their fields of view.

We aggregate all returns from the two stacked 32-beam sensors into a single sweep. These sensors each have different, overlapping fields-of-view. Both lidars have their own reference frame, and we refer to them as `up_lidar` and `down_lidar`, respectively. We have egomotion-compensated the LiDAR sensor data to the egovehicle reference nanosecond timestamp. **All LiDAR returns are provided in the egovehicle reference frame, not the individual LiDAR reference frame**.

Imagery is provided at (height x width) of  `2048 x 1550` (portrait orientation) for the ring front-center camera, and at `1550 x 2048` (landscape orientation) for all other 8 cameras (including the stereo cameras). **All camera imagery is provided in an undistorted format**.

## Dataset Structure Format

Tabular data (annotations, lidar sweeps, poses, calibration) are provided as [Apache Feather Files](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/feather.html) with the file extension `.feather`. We show examples below.

## Annotations
Object annotations are provided as 3d cuboids. Their pose is provided in the egovehicle's reference frame.

A local map is provided per log, please refer to the [Map README](../../map/README.md) for additional details.

## Log Distribution Across Cities
Vehicle logs from the **AV2 Sensor Dataset** are captured in 6 cities, according to the following distribution:
- Austin, Texas: 31 logs.
- Detroit, Michigan: 117 logs.
- Miami, Florida: 354 logs.
- Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania: 350 logs.
- Palo Alto, California: 22 logs.
- Washington, D.C.: 126 logs.

## Privacy

All faces and license plates, whether inside vehicles or outside of the drivable area, are blurred extensively to preserve privacy.

## Sensor Dataset splits

We randomly partitioned 1000 logs into the following splits:

- Train (700 logs)
- Validation (150 logs)
- Test (150 logs)

## Sensor Dataset Taxonomy

The AV2 Sensor Dataset contains 10 Hz 3D cuboid annotations for objects within our 30 class taxonomy. Objects are annotated if they are within the âregion of interestâ (ROI) â within five meters of the mapped âdriveableâ area.

![cuboids-by-category](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29715011/158675968-3987b2bc-ed8b-4194-85ca-44298805cfb2.png)

These 30 classes are defined as follows, appearing in order of frequency:

1. `REGULAR_VEHICLE`:
Any conventionally sized passenger vehicle used for the transportation of people and cargo. This includes Cars, vans, pickup trucks, SUVs, etc.

2. ``PEDESTRIAN``:
Person that is not driving or riding in/on a vehicle. They can be walking, standing, sitting, prone, etc.

3. `BOLLARD`:
Bollards are short, sturdy posts installed in the roadway or sidewalk to control the flow of traffic. These may be temporary or permanent and are sometimes decorative.

4. `CONSTRUCTION_CONE`:
Movable traffic cone that is used to alert drivers to a hazard.  These will typically be orange and white striped and may or may not have a blinking light attached to the top.

5. `CONSTRUCTION_BARREL`:
Construction Barrel is a movable traffic barrel that is used to alert drivers to a hazard.  These will typically be orange and white striped and may or may not have a blinking light attached to the top.

6. `STOP_SIGN`:
Red octagonal traffic sign displaying the word STOP used to notify drivers that they must come to a complete stop and make sure no other road users are coming before proceeding.

7. `BICYCLE`:
Non-motorized vehicle that typically has two wheels and is propelled by human power pushing pedals in a circular motion.

8. `LARGE_VEHICLE`:
Large motorized vehicles (four wheels or more) which do not fit into any more specific subclass. Examples include extended passenger vans, fire trucks, RVs, etc.

9. `WHEELED_DEVICE`:
Objects involved in the transportation of a person and do not fit a more specific class. Examples range from skateboards, non-motorized scooters, segways, to golf-carts.

10. `BUS`:
Standard city buses designed to carry a large number of people.

11. `BOX_TRUCK`:
Chassis cab truck with an enclosed cube shaped cargo area. It should be noted that the cargo area is rigidly attached to the cab, and they do not articulate.

12. `SIGN`:
Official road signs placed by the Department of Transportation (DOT signs) which are of interest to us. This includes yield signs, speed limit signs, directional control signs, construction signs, and other signs that provide required traffic control information. Note that Stop Sign is captured separately and informative signs such as street signs, parking signs, bus stop signs, etc. are not included in this class.

13. `TRUCK`:
Vehicles that are clearly defined as a truck but does not fit into the subclasses of Box Truck or Truck Cab. Examples include common delivery vehicles (UPS, FedEx), mail trucks, garbage trucks, utility trucks, ambulances, dump trucks, etc.

14. `MOTORCYCLE`:
Motorized vehicle with two wheels where the rider straddles the engine.  These are capable of high speeds similar to a car.

15. `BICYCLIST`:
Person actively riding a bicycle, non-pedaling passengers included.

16. `VEHICULAR_TRAILER`:
Non-motorized, wheeled vehicle towed behind a motorized vehicle.

17. `TRUCK_CAB`:
Heavy truck commonly known as âSemi cabâ, âTractorâ, or âLorryâ. This refers to only the front of part of an articulated tractor trailer.

18. `MOTORCYCLIST`:
Person actively riding a motorcycle or a moped, including passengers.

19. `DOG`:
Any member of the canine family.

20. `SCHOOL_BUS`:
Bus that primarily holds school children (typically yellow) and can control the flow of traffic via the use of an articulating stop sign and loading/unloading flasher lights.

21. `WHEELED_RIDER`:
Person actively riding or being carried by a wheeled device.

22. `STROLLER`:
Push-cart with wheels meant to hold a baby or toddler.

23. `ARTICULATED_BUS`:
Articulated buses perform the same function as a standard city bus, but are able to bend (articulate) towards the center. These will also have a third set of wheels not present on a typical bus.

24. `MESSAGE_BOARD_TRAILER`:
Trailer carrying a large, mounted, electronic sign to display messages. Often found around construction sites or large events.

25. `MOBILE_PEDESTRIAN_SIGN`:
